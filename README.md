# Semester CGPA Calculator

A collection of C++ programs designed to help students calculate their semester-wise Grade Point Average (GPA). Each program is tailored for a specific semester, taking into account the subjects and their corresponding credit hours.

## 📜 Description

This repository contains individual C++ files, each representing a semester's CGPA calculator. These command-line applications prompt the user to input their marks for various assessments like assignments, quizzes, mid-term exams, and final exams for each subject. Based on the provided marks, the program calculates the total percentage, grade points for each subject, and finally, the overall GPA for that semester.

## ✨ Features

* **Semester-wise Calculation:** Separate calculators for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd semesters.
* **Detailed Mark Entry:** Input marks for assignments, quizzes, mids, and finals.
* **Automatic GPA Calculation:** Automatically calculates the grade points and the final GPA.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and interactive command-line interface.
* **Clear Result Display:** Shows a detailed table with subjects, percentages, credit hours, and grades.

## 🚀 How to Use

To use these calculators, you will need a C++ compiler (like G++).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

3.  **Compile the desired semester's file:**
    For example, to compile the 1st-semester calculator:
    ```bash
    g++ "1st Semester CGPA Calculator.cpp" -o semester1_calculator
    ```
    Replace the filename accordingly for other semesters.

4.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./semester1_calculator
    ```

5.  **Follow the on-screen instructions** to enter your marks and get your GPA.
